### C2512: '-template-class-constructor-': no appropriate default constructor available (with)
when appearing together with
### C2614: '-template-class-' illegal member initialization: '-template-base-class-' is not a base or member


```cpp
template <typename Value>
struct some_class : public base_class<Impl>
{
   // construct 'some_class' and call the base class constructor 'base_class'
   some_class(Value &v): base_class(v) {}
                            ^^^^^
};
```

#### Description:
Previously, `base_class` was implicitly understood as `base_class<Impl>`. This is no longer the case.

#### Solution:
Use the fully qualified template name to call the base class constructor.
```cpp
template <typename Value>
struct some_class : public base_class<Impl>
{
   // construct 'some_class' and call the base class constructor 'base_class'
   some_class(Value &v): base_class<Value>(v) {}
                                    ^^^^^
};
```
